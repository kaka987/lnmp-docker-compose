How to Properly Choose Your Blog\'s Niche.</h2>\r\n    <p>We all know that your blog needs a niche – whether it\'s marketing, cooking, Crossfit exercises, vegan dogsitting,\r\n        underwater parkour solo dancing – whatever, there are an endless amount of things to blog about.</p>\r\n    <p>Most bloggers will tell you to start with something that you\'re passionate about because it will help you\r\n        \"maintain a consistent writing schedule and push through the hard times when things get difficult.\"</p>\r\n    <p>They\'ll also tell you to choose a niche at the intersection of passion, skills, and experience:</p>\r\n    <p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-42851\"\r\n            src=\"/static/image/blog/Choosing-your-blogs-niche.jpg\"\r\n            alt=\"Choosing Your Blog Niche\"></p>\r\n    <p>However, this model is flawed because it\'s missing one major component: <strong>monetization.</strong></p>\r\n    <p><strong>I firmly believe that with a blog, money drives passion more than passion drives money.&nbsp;</strong>\r\n    </p>\r\n    <p>Let\'s say you take this common advice and choose your blog\'s niche based on passion, skills, and experience.</p>\r\n    <p>In this example, your passion is fitness, your skills are helping people lose weight, and your experience is that\r\n        you\'re a personal trainer focused on high-intensity interval training (HIIT).</p>\r\n    <p>So you decide to create a fitness blog specifically designed to help people lose weight with HIIT.</p>\r\n    <ul>\r\n        <li>You write 20 blog posts</li>\r\n        <li>Incorporate exercise videos</li>\r\n        <li>Create Instagram and YouTube channels</li>\r\n        <li>Build an <em>About Me</em> page and <em>FAQ</em> to tell your story</li>\r\n        <li>Add Amazon affiliate links to fitness products</li>\r\n        <li>And build your email list with your lead magnet – <em>The Top 25 HIIT Workouts to Lose 5 Pounds in 7\r\n            Days</em></li>\r\n    </ul>\r\n    <p>When a user signs up for the email list, they receive a final email offer on day 7 for a free online personal\r\n        training consultation, with the end goal of having them become a recurring monthly customer.</p>\r\n    <p><strong>This all sounds very exciting. However, I can almost certainly guarantee that this blog will\r\n        fail.</strong></p>\r\n    <p>Why?</p>\r\n    <p>Monetization wasn\'t priority #1 when choosing this niche – it was passions, skills, and experience.</p>\r\n    <p>This niche is going to take years to monetize. And when things take years to monetize, the likelihood of quitting\r\n        is exponentially higher.</p>\r\n    <p><strong>Because that\'s the myth: it takes years to make money from a blog.&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n    <p>There\'s another problem with this strategy, and it comes from human nature: our desire for significance.</p>\r\n    <p>Imagine writing about something you\'re passionate about earnestly for months, and realizing you still have no\r\n        following, no traffic, and not a single dime from all your efforts.</p>\r\n    <p>Think about it. Whether an artist, sculptor, graphic designer, director, producer, wannabe Instagram celebrity,\r\n        or writer, we all want recognition for our work. As social creatures, we need to share the things that we create\r\n        with other human beings.</p>\r\n    <p>Think of a child showing a drawing to one of their parents. Or watching a movie you\'ve already seen with a friend\r\n        because you want to share it with them. Or seeing your name in movie credits. Or finally getting a book\r\n        published.</p>\r\n    <p>We strive for significance and meaning in our lives.</p>\r\n    <p><strong>I could write about my passions, skills, and experience for a while, but if I wasn\'t gaining any\r\n        readership or making any money, I\'d quit 100% of the time.&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n    <p>And that\'s why 95% of bloggers fail – they start with a passion in mind, but don\'t know how to treat it like a\r\n        business from day one.</p>\r\n    <p>They write for years, get burned out when they don\'t see results, and quit.</p>\r\n    <p><strong>So we\'re going to flip the script and start your blog like a business from the very\r\n        beginning.&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n    <p>To do this, we\'ll choose your ideal niche based on the real primary factors: <strong>audience revenue potential,\r\n        professional leverage, and keyword research.&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n    <p><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-42866\"\r\n            src=\"/static/image/blog/Your-True-Ideal-Niche-1024x731.jpg\"\r\n            alt=\"Your True Ideal Niche\"\r\n    ></p>\r\n    <h3>1. Audience Revenue Potential.</h3>\r\n    <p>When you\'re starting a new blog, the question shouldn\'t be, <em>What is my niche?</em> But, <em>Who is my\r\n        audience and what pain point am I trying to solve?</em></p>\r\n    <p><strong>In order to offer a valuable product on your blog and make money, you need to solve a pain point that an\r\n        audience is willing to spend money on.&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n    <p>As a blogger, you need to understand your audience\'s challenges deeply so that you can offer them exactly what\r\n        they want.</p>\r\n    <p>And the best place to start is by looking at yourself.</p>\r\n    <p>Ask yourself, <em>What audiences am I a part of? </em></p>\r\n    <p><strong>You\'re far more likely to understand a specific group\'s struggles if you\'ve encountered them yourself.&nbsp;</strong>\r\n    </p>\r\n    <p>Take my blog, for example.</p>\r\n    <p>When I started this blog, I was a 31-year old American male working in the tech industry. I was putting in long\r\n        hours, sacrificing time with my family and friends, and getting stressed and burned out by the rat race. So I\r\n        created this blog as a means to an end – a way to make passive income, escape my 9-5 and take back control of my\r\n        time – and my life.</p>\r\n    <p><strong>So my target audience was people similar to me:</strong></p>\r\n    <ul>\r\n        <li>25-45 years old</li>\r\n        <li>Working 9-5 but want to escape the rat race</li>\r\n        <li>Ready to hustle and put in the work</li>\r\n        <li>Smart and technically savvy</li>\r\n        <li>Want to make passive income through a blog</li>\r\n    </ul>\r\n    <p>Understanding your audience is the first step.</p>\r\n    <p>The second (and equally important) step is to understand <em>how much your audience is willing to spend to solve\r\n        their pain points.</em></p>\r\n    <p><strong>This is your audience revenue potential.</strong></p>\r\n    <p>This bears repeating: <strong>you need to understand your audience AND how much they\'re willing to spend to solve\r\n        their pain points.</strong></p>\r\n    <p><img class=\"size-full wp-image-44283 aligncenter\"\r\n            src=\"/static/image/blog/Most-Profitable-Blog-Niches.jpg\"\r\n            alt=\"Most Profitable Blog Niches\"\r\n    ></p>\r\n    <p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Source: <a href=\"https://www.successunscrambled.com/most-profitable-blog-niches/\"\r\n                                                  target=\"_blank\"\r\n                                                  rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">successunscrambled.com</a></em></p>\r\n    <p>For example, let\'s say you\'re planning to start a blog in the home design niche.</p>\r\n    <p>Your blog topics may pull in different readers, including professional interior designers, college design\r\n        students, and even stay-at-home moms who want the latest home decor inspiration.</p>\r\n    <p><strong>To monetize a blog in this niche, let\'s say you create a sales funnel:</strong></p>\r\n    <ul>\r\n        <li>You write new content to attract an audience online</li>\r\n        <li>Next, you build a home design lead magnet to get email opt-ins</li>\r\n        <li>Third, you place affiliate links to promote home decor brands</li>\r\n        <li>Finally, you offer a $300 online course titled <em>10 Expert Interior Designers Share Tips for the Perfect\r\n            Home</em></li>\r\n    </ul>\r\n    <p>Nothing is wrong with this approach.</p>\r\n    <p>In fact, this tends to be a common approach most bloggers take. If you were to put in a few years of content\r\n        creation and built up your email list enough, I estimate you could start making a passive income in 2-3\r\n        years.</p>\r\n    <p><strong>However, by changing just one word in your potential niche, you increase your blog\'s income potential by\r\n        100x.</strong></p>\r\n    <p>All you do is change <em>home design</em> to <em>commercial design</em>.</p>\r\n    <p>Let me explain.</p>\r\n    <p>By adding a B2B component to your blog, you shift part of your audience from individuals to businesses.</p>\r\n    <p>Businesses have larger bank accounts and are more likely to pay you without hesitation. Whereas a founder might\r\n        be more frugal with the business\'s account, a middle manager with a budget to spend will not.</p>\r\n    <p>The beautiful thing about this approach is that your blog launch and marketing funnel are almost exactly the same\r\n        for both the \"home design\" and \"commercial design\" niches. However, with the B2B niche, you don\'t just stop at a\r\n        $300 course. You get to add the final component of 5-figure online consulting.</p>\r\n    <p><strong>Just understanding your audience\'s pain points isn\'t enough.</strong></p>\r\n    <p>To 100x your revenue potential, a portion of your audience needs to be in a lucrative B2B niche and pay a monthly\r\n        recurring basis.</p>\r\n    <p>To recap, when choosing your niche, rather than worrying about getting thousands of passive, low-value site\r\n        visitors, focus on closing 2-3 high-value clients.</p>\r\n    <p>With this approach, I hope you\'re beginning to understand why I truly believe you can make $10,000/month in 90\r\n        days with a new blog. These new funds will be used to accelerate your path to passive income, but we\'ll leave it\r\n        at that for now.</p>\r\n    <h3>2. Your Professional Leverage.</h3>\r\n    <p>After uncovering a lucrative audience to provide value to, the next step is to uncover the strategic advantages\r\n        you may have over others.</p>\r\n    <p><strong>Ask yourself:</strong></p>\r\n    <ul>\r\n        <li>What is my current level of professional experience?</li>\r\n        <li>What connections do I have in my industry?</li>\r\n        <li>Can I leverage this experience into a profitable blog?</li>\r\n        <li>If I could pitch any website in the world to contribute a guest post, who would choose me from the start?\r\n        </li>\r\n    </ul>\r\n\r\n    <p>To build a truly successful blog, you first need to build influence. And to build influence, you need to step\r\n        outside of your comfort zone and leverage your connections, professional experience, and everything at your\r\n        disposal like never before.</p>\r\n    <p>With a blog, you\'ll also be performing a lot of outreach to make new connections. This includes building\r\n        relationships so you can guest post on authoritative sites in your niche to get relevant, high Domain Authority\r\n        (DA) backlinks for SEO.</p>\r\n    <p>And when you\'re just starting out, you may not have many connections or published content out there. You might\r\n        say: \"Why would anyone feature me?\"</p>\r\n    <p>This is where leveraging your professional background helps tremendously.</p>\r\n    <p>For example, if you\'re a photographer, you might have a base of clients, contacts from local meet-up groups, and\r\n        even know photography influencers that you met in the past. If you can leverage these contacts in the future,\r\n        you can accelerate the growth of your blog.</p>\r\n    <p>Use every advantage you have at your disposal.</p>\r\n    <h3>3. Keyword Research.</h3>\r\n    <p>To me, keyword research is the most important step when choosing your blog\'s niche.</p>\r\n    <p>It\'s very simple. Are people searching for the things you want to write about?</p>\r\n    <p><strong>It\'s a fact: You need to become an expert in keyword research and search engine optimization (SEO) so\r\n        that your blog can rank on Google.</strong></p>\r\n    <p>Why? People search Google <a href=\"https://seotribunal.com/blog/google-stats-and-facts/\" target=\"_blank\"\r\n                                    rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">63,000 times every second</a>. That\'s 3.8 million searches\r\n        per minute, 228 million searches per hour, and 5.6 billion searches per day. There are plenty of opportunities\r\n        out there – you just have to know how to find them.</p>\r\n    <p>Another good piece of news is that there are SEO tools to\r\n        understand all of this search data. With tools like SEMRush\r\n        and <a href=\"https://www.ahrefs.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Ahrefs</a>, you can view\r\n        individual keyword metrics, including:</p>\r\n    <ul>\r\n        <li><strong>Monthly search volume:</strong> how many times a keyword is searched for in a given month</li>\r\n        <li><strong>Keyword difficulty:</strong> on a scale from 0 to 100, how difficult is it to rank on Google for\r\n            that keyword based on the competition\r\n        </li>\r\n        <li><b>The average cost per click (CPC):</b> this is how much the keyword is worth if you were to create a\r\n            Google PPC ad for it and pay for the click. It\'s a good indicator of the keyword\'s value\r\n        </li>\r\n    </ul>\r\n    <p>So what do you look for?</p>\r\n    <p><strong>You want to find keywords with high volume and low competition.&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n    <p>Here\'s how I rate these competitive metrics.</p>\r\n    <p><strong>Monthly Search Volume:</strong></p>\r\n    <ul>\r\n        <li>0-1,000: Low</li>\r\n        <li>1,000-5,000: Low/Medium</li>\r\n        <li>5,000-20,000: Medium</li>\r\n        <li>20,000-100,000: High</li>\r\n        <li>100,000+: Very High</li>\r\n    </ul>\r\n    <p><strong>Keyword Difficulty:</strong></p>\r\n    <ul>\r\n        <li>0-20: Low</li>\r\n        <li>21-50: Medium</li>\r\n        <li>51-75: High</li>\r\n        <li>76+: Very High</li>\r\n    </ul>\r\n    <p>On my site, there are two main types of keywords I target when it comes to SEO: <strong>super high-volume/high\r\n        competition </strong>and<strong> medium volume, low competition.</strong></p><h4>1. Revenue Drivers: Medium\r\n    Volume, Low Competition, High CPC Keywords</h4>\r\n    <p>The first keywords new bloggers should search for are medium volume, low competition keywords.</p>\r\n\r\n    <ul>\r\n        <li>Target keyword: webinar software</li>\r\n        <li>Monthly search volume: 4,300</li>\r\n        <li>Keyword difficulty: 22</li>\r\n        <li>Average CPC: $25.00</li>\r\n    </ul>\r\n    <p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-44286\"\r\n            src=\"/static/image/blog/Webinar-Software-Keyword-Example.jpg\"\r\n            alt=\"Webinar Software Keyword Example\"\r\n    ></p>\r\n    <p>4,300 is not a very high monthly search volume, but since <a\r\n            href=\"https://www.searchenginepeople.com/blog/page-one-whats-google-rank-worth.html\" target=\"_blank\"\r\n            rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">position 1 gets over 33% of traffic</a>, I could expect to get 1,419\r\n        visitors/month to my blog for position one on this term.</p>\r\n    <p>Plus, with a low keyword difficulty of 22, this term should be relatively easy to rank for (in fact, I got to\r\n        page 1 just a few days after publishing the blog post).</p>\r\n    <p>Finally, with an average CPC of $25, it is a valuable, high-intent search term.</p>\r\n    <p><strong>One quick side note on keyword search volume:</strong> While the keyword <em>webinar software</em> gets\r\n        4,300 searches per month, there are thousands of potential variations of this keyword – for example, <em>best\r\n            webinar software, webinar tools, webinar platforms, etc.&nbsp;</em>This post can rank for all of these\r\n        variations, too, so I typically double or even triple my volume estimates based on the main target keyword.</p>\r\n    <p><strong>Pro Tip:</strong> Using Ahrefs <em>Also Rank for Report</em>, you can view keywords that the top-ranking\r\n        pages for your target keyword also rank for in the top 100 search results. This allows you to find less obvious\r\n        keywords that you can also include in your post\'s copy and subheadings.</p>\r\n    <p>The key to finding relevant keywords from this report to use for your blog is to search with more specific\r\n        queries. For example, instead of \"cooking,\" use \"vegan recipes.\" Or \"email marketing services\" instead of\r\n        \"marketing.\"</p>\r\n    <p><strong>How to find this type of keyword for your blog:</strong> Use an SEO tool like Ahrefs and filter the\r\n        results. Set the monthly search volume filter to a minimum of 1,000 and the Keyword Difficulty filter to a\r\n        maximum of 10.</p>\r\n    <p><strong>What these keywords are good for:</strong> These keywords should make up the bulk of your posts and be\r\n        the main revenue-drivers for your blog. The key is to find a good amount of long-tail keywords with medium\r\n        volume and low competition in your niche. If these keywords are preceded by terms like \"how to\" and \"best,\"\r\n        you\'re well on your way to finding a profitable niche and solving a pain point.</p><h4>2. Blog Builders: Super\r\n    High-Volume/High Competition Keywords</h4>\r\n    <p>The second type of keywords that I target are super high-volume terms that aren\'t as easy to monetize but can\r\n        bring in a lot of traffic.</p>\r\n    <ul>\r\n        <li>Target keyword: how to make money online</li>\r\n        <li>Monthly search volume: 103,000</li>\r\n        <li>Keyword difficulty: 55</li>\r\n        <li>Average CPC: $2.00</li>\r\n    </ul>\r\n    <p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-44287\"\r\n            src=\"/static/image/blog/How-to-Make-Money-Online-Keyword.jpg\"\r\n            alt=\"How to Make Money Online Keyword\"\r\n    ></p>\r\n    <p>First, this keyword has a 25x higher volume than <em>webinar software</em>. With high volume and all of the\r\n        potential keyword variations, ranking in the top 5 positions for this term could bring in 30-65,000\r\n        visitors/month.</p>\r\n    <p>However, this keyword also has a lower search intent than <em>webinar software</em>. With <em>webinar\r\n        software</em>, we know exactly what the searcher is looking for. With <em>how to make money online</em>, this\r\n        user could be interested in anything from starting an online business to podcasting or coupon clipping – we just\r\n        don\'t know.</p>\r\n    <p>So that\'s why it\'s average CPC is only $2.00 – it\'s vaguer and harder to monetize.</p>\r\n    <p><strong>How to find this type of keyword for your blog:</strong> Use an SEO tool like Ahrefs and filter the\r\n        results. Set the monthly search volume filter to a minimum of 20,000 and the Keyword Difficulty filter to a\r\n        maximum of 75.</p>\r\n    <p><strong>What these keywords are good for:</strong> These keywords should make up 5-10 pillar blog posts that you\r\n        put a lot of time and effort into. While these high volume keywords won\'t generate immediate revenue, they bring\r\n        in a ton of traffic to your blog and can increase the size of your email list.</p><h4>3. Summing Up Keyword\r\n    Research</h4>\r\n    <p>A blog needs a mix of both <strong>super high-volume/high competition and medium volume, low competition\r\n        keywords.</strong></p>\r\n    <p><strong>Here are some of the tools you can use for your keyword research: </strong></p>\r\n    <ul>\r\n        <li>SEMrush</li>\r\n        <li><a href=\"https://ahrefs.com/\">Ahrefs</a></li>\r\n        <li><a href=\"https://ads.google.com/intl/en_in/home/tools/keyword-planner/\">Google Keyword Planner</a></li>\r\n    </ul>\r\n    <h4>Wrapping Up Picking Your Niche.</h4>\r\n    <p>After doing your keyword research, discovering a lucrative audience, and planning how to leverage your\r\n        professional connections, it\'s time to get to work.</p>\r\n    <p>Let\'s start planning your new blog.</p>\r\n    <h2>2. Write Down Your Goals.</h2>\r\n    <p>Everyone knows the famous quote by Antoine de Saint-Exupéry, \"A goal without a plan is just a wish.\"</p>\r\n    <p>This is definitely true when starting a new blog. After choosing your niche, you need a way to keep track of\r\n        everything — not just your to-dos and content ideas, but also your goals, ideas, and motivations.</p>\r\n    <p>The key during this stage is not to overcomplicate things.</p>\r\n    <p>When I was starting this blog, I kept track of everything in one simple Google Docs file.</p>\r\n    <p>Here are the sections I used:</p>\r\n    <h3>Your Blog\'s Goals.</h3>\r\n    <p>It\'s time to think big and write down what you want to accomplish with your blog in the short and long term.\r\n        These should be <a href=\"https://www.yourcoach.be/en/coaching-tools/smart-goal-setting.php\" target=\"_blank\"\r\n                           rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">SMART goals</a> – Specific, Measurable, Attainable, Relevant, and\r\n        Timely.</p>\r\n    <p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-44678\"\r\n            src=\"/static/image/blog/Smart-Goals.jpg\" alt=\"Smart Goals for Bloggers\"\r\n    ></p>\r\n    <p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Source: <a href=\"https://fitsmallbusiness.com/smart-goals-examples/\"\r\n                                                  target=\"_blank\"\r\n                                                  rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">fitsmallbusiness.com</a></em></p>\r\n    <p>Here are a few examples from my document when I started planning my blog:</p>\r\n    <ul>\r\n        <li>Write and publish my first five blog posts of 2,000+ words by January 20</li>\r\n        <li>Complete my About Me page by January 25</li>\r\n        <li>Publish five guest posts by February 1</li>\r\n        <li>Get 1,000 blog site visitors/month by February 15</li>\r\n        <li>Get 250 people in my email list by February 15</li>\r\n        <li>Obtain 100 backlinks by March 1</li>\r\n    </ul>\r\n    <p>As you can see, these are all short term attainable goals with clear due dates.</p>\r\n    <h3>Your Blog\'s Profile.</h3>\r\n    <p>You need a place to keep track of your random ideas and unique selling points to hone in on your messaging over\r\n        time.</p>\r\n    <p>Sections here may include:</p>\r\n    <ul>\r\n        <li>Your unique value proposition</li>\r\n        <li>Your blog\'s headline and sub-headline</li>\r\n        <li>What is the problem you solve?</li>\r\n        <li>Your blog\'s \"elevator pitch\" – in 1-2 sentences, how would you easily explain your blog to a stranger?</li>\r\n        <li>Your ideal customer personas</li>\r\n        <li>What are the main categories for your blog?</li>\r\n        <li>Future content ideas with target keywords and search volume</li>\r\n    </ul>\r\n    <p>That\'s it. The key is to make this a living document and update however you see fit.</p>\r\n    <p>To plan a blog, set some simple goals, and write things down to better hone in on your blog\'s message, and\r\n        understand who your audience is.</p>\r\n    <h2><a id=\"post-41422-_nm2hv6nshhur\"></a>3. Pick a Domain Name.</h2>\r\n    <p>In the past, I took way too much time on this step. I scoured GoDaddy for weeks trying to find the perfect\r\n        catchy, niche-specific, short, memorable dot com domain name.</p>\r\n    <p>While this step is important, it\'s probably not as important as you think.</p>\r\n    <p>In the past, it was possible to get exact-match keyword domain names like cuttingboards.com to help you rank on\r\n        Google. Today, it\'s much more difficult.</p>\r\n    <p>While common advice is to \"niche down\" and choose an ultra-specific domain name, I recommend you choose a domain\r\n        name that\'s broad enough to allow you to pivot if necessary.</p>\r\n    <p>If your focus is too narrow and suddenly you lose passion for your niche or run out of topic ideas, you\'re stuck\r\n        with your new domain. However, if you broaden your focus a little bit, you can expand your content and have\r\n        enough fluidity to maintain consistency and avoid quitting.</p>\r\n    <p>In the past, I tried starting online businesses and chose ultra-specific domain names. When I didn\'t see\r\n        immediate success, I got discouraged and thought, \"Well, maybe this niche isn\'t for me. I should quit and try\r\n        something else.\"</p>\r\n    <p>Here\'s what you should do instead: <strong>choose a broader domain name and worry about being specific in your\r\n        posts and pages.</strong></p>\r\n    <p>Here are some other things you need to consider before picking a domain name.</p>\r\n    <h3><a id=\"post-41422-_9kfwa4ncqzt2\"></a>1. The Price of the Domain Name.</h3>\r\n    <p>You have to buy your blog\'s domain name from a domain registrar company. It should cost you roughly $10/year. If\r\n        you get started with <a class=\"thirstylink\" title=\"Bluehost\"\r\n                                href=\"https://www.bluehost.com/track/marlin2019/\" target=\"_blank\"\r\n                                rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Bluehost</a> web hosting, you get a free domain name\r\n        for the first year.</p>\r\n    <p><strong>To get started with <a class=\"thirstylink\" title=\"Bluehost\"\r\n                                      href=\"https://www.bluehost.com/track/marlin2019/\" target=\"_blank\"\r\n                                      rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Bluehost</a> and get 63% off your hosting plan,\r\n        use my link below:</strong></p>\r\n    <div data-alignment=\"left\" data-button-size=\"small\"><a href=\"https://www.bluehost.com/track/marlin2019/\"\r\n                                                           class=\"su-button su-button-style-default\"\r\n                                                           style=\"color:#FFFFFF;background-color:#1e8dfc;border-color:#1871ca;border-radius:9px;-moz-border-radius:9px;-webkit-border-radius:9px;    height: 35px;\r\n    display: block;\r\n    width: 160px;\"\r\n                                                           target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span\r\n            style=\"color:#FFFFFF;padding:0px 24px;font-size:18px;line-height:36px;border-color:#62b0fd;border-radius:9px;-moz-border-radius:9px;-webkit-border-radius:9px;text-shadow:none;-moz-text-shadow:none;-webkit-text-shadow:none\"> Try Bluehost</span></a>\r\n    </div>\r\n    <p>That said, some high-quality domains can run you as high as $10,000 to $1MM depending on the perceived value.</p>\r\n    <h3><a id=\"post-41422-_bc3s9dn15ijn\"></a>2. Your Personal Name as a Domain Name?</h3>\r\n    <p>Many people prefer to use their own names for their blogs (like yours truly here). Personal domain names are more\r\n        flexible than the ones based on any particular niche. Many times, bloggers need to change the name of their blog\r\n        according to the changing scenario of their blogging niche.</p>\r\n    <p>However, if your name is your domain, then there is no need to change it when you want to add more verticals to\r\n        your niche.</p>\r\n    <h3><a id=\"post-41422-_hjrio8blx48n\"></a>3. Domain Extensions.</h3>\r\n    <p>Domain names come with different extensions – .com, .us, .guru, .sport, .com, etc.</p>\r\n    <p>.us stands for the United States, .guru is used for coaching blogs, and .sport is used for sports blogs.</p>\r\n    <p>However, .com is the top-level domain that\'s more inclusive and mostly favored by Google and other search\r\n        engines.</p>\r\n    <p>Here\'s how internet users perceive some of the <a href=\"https://growthbadger.com/top-level-domains/\">top-level\r\n        domains in terms of trustworthiness</a>, on a scale of 1 – 5:</p>\r\n    <p><img class=\"wp-image-41427\"\r\n            src=\"/static/image/blog/how-to-start-a-blog-domain-name-statistic.jpeg\"\r\n            alt=\"How to Start a Blog - Domain Name Statistic\"\r\n    >\r\n    </p>\r\n    <h3><a id=\"post-41422-_wb58zdl47jg9\"></a><strong>Other Things to Consider When Choosing a Domain Name:</strong></h3>\r\n    <ol>\r\n        <li>Your domain name should not be too difficult and complex to type. It should be easy to remember and type.\r\n            That\'s why a dot com extension is an excellent option.\r\n        </li>\r\n        <li>Do not confuse people with difficult spellings and therefore keep the name that is easy to spell and\r\n            pronounce.\r\n        </li>\r\n        <li>Avoid using numbers and hyphens in your domain as it confuses people.</li>\r\n        <li>Try to incorporate a keyword that best represents your blog if possible. It\'s not as important to have a\r\n            keyword in your blog name, but it might help people identify your blog\'s niche right away. Plus, it also\r\n            helps search engine spiders determine what your blog is all about.\r\n        </li>\r\n    </ol>\r\n    <p>Check out the tools mentioned in this article to generate your own domain – 27 Best Name Generators.</p>\r\n    <p>If your preferred domain name is not available, most of the tools mentioned in the article will provide you with\r\n        alternate suggestions.</p>\r\n    <h2><a id=\"post-41422-_i0wmpy7kh6ox\"></a>4. Choose a Web Hosting Company &amp; Register Your Domain Name.</h2>\r\n    <p>Every website needs a web host to store it on a server so that people can access it on the internet. Naturally,\r\n        without a hosting account, your blog won\'t be visible on the internet.</p>\r\n    <p>The performance of your blog will rely heavily on your web hosting provider. An excellent hosting platform will\r\n        make your blog available on the internet 24/7 without causing any interruption.</p>\r\n    <p>You should choose a host that is reliable, popular, and comes at an affordable price.

This will make your blog\r\n            managing the task easier and help you gain massive traffic.\r\n        </li>\r\n        <li>WordPress also allows users to give ratings to their themes; hence, make sure to check out the reviews &amp;\r\n            ratings to discern the quality of the theme.\r\n        </li>\r\n        <li>Before installing a theme, make sure to check its demo or preview to know how it looks in real-time.</li>\r\n    </ol>\r\n    <p>The best thing about the theme is that you can change it anytime you want, without disrupting your content.</p>\r\n    <p><strong>You can also install a large number of WordPress themes from other popular sites, such as:</strong></p>\r\n    <ul>\r\n        <li>Themeforest.</li>\r\n        <li>StudioPress.</li>\r\n        <li>Thrive Themes.</li>\r\n        <li>Elementor.</li>\r\n        <li>Elegant Themes.</li>\r\n        <li>CSS Igniter.</li>\r\n    </ul>\r\n    <h3><a id=\"post-41422-_44va01cg95oo\"></a>Free, Premium, And Custom Themes.</h3>\r\n    <p>There are many free blog themes available on WordPress and other websites as well. However, sometimes, they\r\n        aren\'t enough to satisfy the needs of the users and come with limited options.</p>\r\n    <p>That said, as a new blogger, you can start your blog with a free theme and then move on to a more personalized\r\n        option. As long as it loads fast and allows you to start publishing content, there\'s no reason not just to get\r\n        started now and worry about your perfect design later.</p>\r\n    <p>Premium themes mostly come in the price range of $30 to $500. Custom themes are designed according to the\r\n        specific design needs of the website or blog owners. Therefore, these themes come with a hefty price and can\r\n        range from $500 to $2000, according to the needs of the users.</p>\r\n    <h2><a id=\"post-41422-_ep5z8kput6oq\"></a>6. Install Your WordPress Plugins.</h2>\r\n    <p>The best thing about WordPress is that its open-source nature allows it to be customized in an endless amount of\r\n        ways. And it starts with WordPress plugins.</p>\r\n    <p>Plugins are a small set of software tools that are used to enhance the functionality of your WordPress site.</p>\r\n    <p>You can install many plugins to add additional features to your site without any coding skills.</p>\r\n    <p>WordPress literally offers thousands of plugins with different functionalities, including for email marketing, enhancing the SEO of your site.</p>\r\n    <p>However, it is not recommended to install hundreds of plugins on your site as they are bound to slow down your\r\n        website and create conflict with each other. Moreover, it is quite complex for site owners to manage hundreds of\r\n        plugin efficiently. If any problem occurs, then it will be difficult for you to find which plugin is creating a\r\n        problem.</p>\r\n    <p><strong>That\'s why I curated a list of the 15 best WordPress plugins to help you enhance your new blog (and the\r\n        ones I use): </strong></p>\r\n    <h3>1. <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-asset-clean-up/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Asset\r\n        CleanUp: Page Speed Booster.</a></h3>\r\n    <p>This plugin allows you to remove certain elements of code that aren\'t necessary to load on every page. For\r\n        example, my ecommerce CSS files were loading on every blog post even though I only needed them on two pages.\r\n        With this tool, you can easily select which pieces of code to keep and which to remove based on pages, posts,\r\n        and other types of content.</p>\r\n    <h3>2. BigCommerce for WordPress.</h3>\r\n    <p>This is the ecommerce tool that I use to sell my digital products. I tested WooCommerce first, but it installed\r\n        four plugins, slowed down my site, and had an ugly checkout experience. BigCommerce for WordPress launched in\r\n        December 2018 and runs via an API – so you handle all of your content in WordPress and your backend ecommerce in\r\n        BigCommerce.</p>\r\n    <h3>3. <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/classic-editor/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Classic\r\n        Editor.</a></h3>\r\n    <p>I\'m not a huge fan of the new Gutenberg editor and find the Classic Editor much easier to use and more\r\n        error-free.</p>\r\n    <h3>4. <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/easy-table-of-contents/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Easy\r\n        Table of Contents.</a></h3>\r\n    <p>This plugin allows you to easily add a Table of Contents into any page or post. The plugin will appear underneath\r\n        your pages/posts, and you can select if every H2, H3, or any other header should be automatically added to the\r\n        Table of Contents.</p>\r\n    <p>Tables of Contents are important for a few reasons: they keep users engaged with the page (by clicking around)\r\n        and help with user experience. I often have a Table of Contents at the top of my new posts going to each\r\n        section, then a \"Back to Top\" link at the bottom of each section so that users can easily go back to the Table\r\n        of Contents.</p>\r\n    <h3>5. Elementor Pro.</h3>\r\n    <p>Elementor Pro is the best WordPress landing page builder, and it\'s the tool I used to create my home page and a\r\n        few other pages. They have a free version of Elementor, but the Pro version takes it to the next level with much\r\n        better templates.</p>\r\n    <p>You can get started with the free version of Elementor Pro for just $49/year.</p>\r\n    <h3>6. <a href=\"https://createandcode.com/coupons/extended-widget-options/\" target=\"_blank\"\r\n              rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Extended Widget Options.</a></h3>\r\n    <p>Widgets are areas on your WordPress site that aren\'t directly pages or posts. For example, sidebars, footers, and\r\n        homepage sections can be considered widgets. Extended Widget Options allows you to expand the functionality of\r\n        your widgets to make them more useful.</p>\r\n    <p>For example, I use this tool to make some of my sidebar banners sticky so that they scroll down the page with the\r\n        reader.</p>\r\n    <h3>7. <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/cookie-law-info/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">GDPR\r\n        Cookie Consent.</a></h3>\r\n    <p>This is a plugin that can make you GDPR compliant and make sure that you provide a popup highlighting how you use\r\n        cookies to readers in the EU.</p>\r\n    <h3>8. <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/mammoth-docx-converter/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Mammoth\r\n        .docx Converter.</a></h3>\r\n    <p>I use this plugin to convert Google Docs into WordPress posts automatically. Since I get a lot of my initial\r\n        first drafts written for me, I download them as a .docx file from Google Docs and insert them into my\r\n        posts/pages with this plugin. The Mammoth .docx Converter will appear underneath your posts/pages, and it\'s as\r\n        simple as uploading your file and clicking \"Insert into Editor.\"</p>\r\n    <p>One small detail is that you\'ll want to make sure your Google Doc images have both names and alt text before\r\n        uploading into WordPress.</p>\r\n    <h3>9. OptinMonster.</h3>\r\n    <p>OptinMonster is hands down the best email opt-in plugin on the market (and 100% how you joined this list). With\r\n        the ability to create exit intent, modal popups, in-content opt-ins, and more, they are the reason that my email\r\n        list is growing by about 60-75 users/day.</p>\r\n    <p>While I use their highest tier Growth Plan, you can get started with OptinMonster for just $9/month.</p>\r\n    <h3>10. <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/shortcodes-ultimate/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Shortcodes\r\n        Ultimate.</a></h3>\r\n    <p>This plugin allows you to create simple blocks of content by adding shortcodes to your site. I primarily use this\r\n        to insert buttons quickly on my affiliate pages so that readers have very clear calls-to-action. Shortcodes\r\n        Ultimate will appear in your WordPress page editor as a small button at the top (much like Bold, Paragraph\r\n        Spacing, etc.), and when you click into it, you select your content block. With buttons, you can preview them in\r\n        the editor and choose the size, color, style, and more.</p>\r\n    <h3>11. ShortPixel Image Optimizer.</h3>\r\n    <p>ShortPixel compresses all of your images so that they are smaller files and your pages load faster. I\'ve tested\r\n        lots of different image compression plugins, and ShortPixel has been the best.</p>\r\n    <h3>12. ThirstyAffiliates.</h3>\r\n    <p>This is one of my favorite affiliate marketing plugins. ThirstyAffiliates takes your random affiliate links (full\r\n        of random numbers, letter strings, etc.) and cleans them up so that they look nice. For example, which one looks\r\n        nicer:</p>\r\n    <p>https://thirstyaffiliates.com/?aff=29e1c59be16c852</p>\r\n    <p>https://www.howstarts.com/recommends/thirstyaffiliates</p>\r\n    <p>The second one is more clickable, leads to higher conversion rates, and can\'t be stolen by others.</p>\r\n    <h3>13. <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-last-modified-info/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">WP\r\n        Last Modified Info.</a></h3>\r\n    <p>One factor in search engine rankings is recency of content – especially if you\'re in niches with new information\r\n        coming out. This plugin allows you to easily show the date on every page/post so that Google and other search\r\n        engines understand when it was last modified. For example, with WordPress, it\'s easy to show a date, but it will\r\n        typically show the Publish Date, not the last time you edited it.</p>\r\n    <p>By giving search engines an easy way to pull the Modified Date, you will see this date appear in your search\r\n        results, and may see a rankings boost.</p>\r\n    <h3>14. WP Rocket.</h3>\r\n    <p>WP Rocket is an all-in-one site speed plugin that can do everything from minifying HMTL, CSS, and JavaScript,\r\n        integrate with your CDN, reduce database bloat, and more. I\'ve tried other speed plugins like Autoptimize and\r\n        had some issues with it. WP Rocket is the best, in my opinion.</p>\r\n    <p>You can get started with WP Rocket for $49/year.</p>\r\n    <h3>15. <a href=\"https://yoast.com/wordpress/plugins/seo/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Yoast SEO.</a>\r\n    </h3>\r\n    <p>Yoast SEO doesn\'t really need an introduction. If you\'re not using it, then you\'re missing out on a lot of great\r\n        free SEO features. I use Yoast to manage my sitemap, robots.txt, page titles/meta descriptions, and a whole lot\r\n        more.</p>\r\n    <h2><a id=\"post-41422-_9whogifjb09f\"></a>7.

Your blog posts\r\n            should always provide value to your readers. Make a clear idea about the content (based on the questions\r\n            mentioned above) and write down the points that you want to cover. Finally, structure your whole blog post\r\n            according to predefined points.\r\n        </li>\r\n        <li>Present your blog content attractively and make it easily accessible to the readers. Make sure both textual\r\n            and visual content in the blog are of top-notch quality.\r\n        </li>\r\n        <li>Never make your content commercially focused as it irritates readers. Blogs loaded with too many advertising\r\n            and promotional links look unattractive to most people. Your audience will only engage with your blog if you\r\n            provide them with valuable content.\r\n        </li>\r\n    </ul>\r\n    <h3><a id=\"post-41422-_e66kofav80j9\"></a>A Quick Checklist To Consider Before Writing Your Blog Posts.</h3>\r\n    <ul>\r\n        <li>Make your blog post conversational to make it engaging connect with your audience</li>\r\n        <li>Make sure your content flows naturally</li>\r\n        <li>Leave out substantial white space to make it easy on the eyes</li>\r\n        <li>Add bullet points to help readers skim down the blog without missing anything critical</li>\r\n        <li>Use proper H2, H3, H4 headings</li>\r\n        <li>Double-check for typos and grammatical errors</li>\r\n    </ul>\r\n    <h3><a id=\"post-41422-_qzsmjms3f9fq\"></a>Write Your First Blog.</h3>\r\n    <p>You are now on your way to become a world-famous blogger.</p>\r\n    <p>Here\'s how to proceed writing your first post on WordPress:</p>\r\n    <p>Click on \"Posts\" in the left sidebar from your WordPress dashboard.</p>\r\n    <p><img class=\"wp-image-41456\"\r\n            src=\"/static/image/blog/how-to-start-a-blog-write-your-first-post.png\"\r\n            alt=\"How to start a blog - write your first post\"\r\n            srcset=\"/static/image/blog/how-to-start-a-blog-write-your-first-post.png 800w, /static/image/blog/how-to-start-a-blog-write-your-first-post-300x187.png 300w, /static/image/blog/how-to-start-a-blog-write-your-first-post-768x479.png 768w, /static/image/blog/how-to-start-a-blog-write-your-first-post-555x346.png 555w\"\r\n            sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" data-pin-description=\"How to start a blog - write your first post\">\r\n    </p>\r\n    <p>Now, select the \"Add New\" button:</p>\r\n    <p><img class=\"wp-image-41457\"\r\n            src=\"/static/image/blog/how-to-start-a-blog-add-a-new-post-to-wordpress.png\"\r\n            alt=\"How to start a blog - add a new post to WordPress\"\r\n            srcset=\"/static/image/blog/how-to-start-a-blog-add-a-new-post-to-wordpress.png 800w, /static/image/blog/how-to-start-a-blog-add-a-new-post-to-wordpress-300x176.png 300w, /static/image/blog/how-to-start-a-blog-add-a-new-post-to-wordpress-768x449.png 768w, /static/image/blog/how-to-start-a-blog-add-a-new-post-to-wordpress-555x325.png 555w\"\r\n            sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\"\r\n            data-pin-description=\"How to start a blog - add a new post to WordPress\"></p>\r\n    <p>Next, you will head to the editor, where you can start writing your first blog.</p>\r\n    <p><img class=\"wp-image-41458\"\r\n            src=\"/static/image/blog/how-to-start-a-blog-wordpress-editor.png\"\r\n            alt=\"How to start a blog - wordpress editor\"\r\n            srcset=\"/static/image/blog/how-to-start-a-blog-wordpress-editor.png 800w, /static/image/blog/how-to-start-a-blog-wordpress-editor-300x134.png 300w, /static/image/blog/how-to-start-a-blog-wordpress-editor-768x343.png 768w, /static/image/blog/how-to-start-a-blog-wordpress-editor-555x248.png 555w\"\r\n            sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" data-pin-description=\"How to start a blog - wordpress editor\"></p>\r\n    <p>While crafting your blog post, make sure to keep the above tips in mind.</p>\r\n    <p>After you are done with your article, make sure to make some optimizations to make it rank higher in search\r\n        engines.</p>\r\n    <p>This can be done easily using the Yoast SEO plugin (what I mentioned before as well).</p>\r\n    <h3><a id=\"post-41422-_34anfcxkhyo5\"></a>CREATE PRE-LAUNCH CONTENT.</h3>\r\n    <p>Pre-launch content includes the content for static pages of the blog, such as About us, Contact, Home Page, and\r\n        more.</p><h4><a id=\"post-41422-_odsnrpaz8kaz\"></a>1.

The first step is <a\r\n            href=\"https://www.howstarts.com/list/how-to-start-a-blog\">getting web hosting</a> and a domain name. I\r\n        recommend <a class=\"thirstylink\" title=\"Bluehost\" href=\"https://www.bluehost.com/track/marlin2019/\"\r\n                     target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Bluehost</a> as it\'s the #1 recommended host by\r\n        WordPress and has more than enough features to do everything outlined in this guide.</p>\r\n    <p>This article is all about making money in 2019 – I won\'t give you a standard list of options like affiliate\r\n        marketing, sponsored posts, online courses, or advertising.</p>\r\n    <p>Instead, we\'ll focus on scaling your blog like a startup by choosing your niche, scaling your content, and\r\n        monetizing your blog to make $10,000/month in 90 days.</p>\r\n    <p>Here is the most updated advice on a unique step-by-step guide to scaling your blog like a startup in 2019.</p>\r\n    <h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"choose-your-blogs-niche-based-on-market-factors-not-your-passions\">Choose Your Blog\'s Niche Based on Market Factors, Not Your Passions</span>\r\n    </h2>\r\n    <p>There\'s a reason that 99% of bloggers fail, and it\'s not why you think.</p>\r\n    <p>The current myth is that bloggers fail because they aren\'t \"passionate enough.\"</p>\r\n    <p>\"Push through failure to succeed,\" they say.</p>\r\n    <p>Google \"why bloggers fail,\" and you get the same answer from the #1 result: bloggers fail because they aren\'t\r\n        passionate enough.</p>\r\n    <p>I officially reject this notion.</p>\r\n    <p><strong>The real reason bloggers fail is the same reason that any business fails: it\'s not profitable.</strong>\r\n    </p>\r\n    <p>Take my passions, for example.</p>\r\n    <p>I\'m passionate about a lot of things – astronomy, distance running, personal development, <a\r\n            href=\"https://pizzaneed.com/detroit-style-pizza/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Detroit-style\r\n        pizza</a>.</p>\r\n    <p>However, if I wrote an endless amount of blog posts about one of these topics without making any money, I\'d burn\r\n        out 100% of the time.</p>\r\n    <p>Additionally, some bloggers claim, \"I\'m not in it for the money\" or, \"It\'s just a hobby.\"</p>\r\n    <p>Hobby bloggers are just new bloggers that don\'t know how to make money yet. In any creative digital field –\r\n        whether it\'s design, web development, photography, copywriting, or video editing – there are beginners and\r\n        experts.</p>\r\n    <p>And since most bloggers start as beginners by writing about a passion and try to figure everything else out\r\n        later, they\'re destined to fail.</p>\r\n\r\n    <p>Plus, blogging advice is outdated, written only to rank on Google, and encourages a generalized approach to\r\n        appeal to the broadest possible audience.</p>\r\n    <p>Bloggers don\'t fail because of a lack of passion (they have that in spades).</p>\r\n    <p><strong>Bloggers fail because they can\'t transition from blogger to business owner.</strong></p>\r\n    <p>So they choose a non-lucrative niche targeting a low-value audience. New bloggers forget to leverage networking\r\n        and connections to their strategic advantage. And they don\'t have enough market demand to scale traffic.</p>\r\n    <p>I want you to succeed.</p>\r\n    <p>Before launching your blog, it\'s crucial to choose your niche based not on passions, but three business factors:\r\n        <strong>audience budget potential, professional leverage, and market demand.</strong></p>\r\n    <h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"1-audience-budget-potential\">1. Audience Budget Potential</span></h3>\r\n    <p>To offer a valuable product on your blog, you need to solve a pain point for your audience. That\'s obvious.</p>\r\n    <p>As a blogger, you should deeply understand your audience\'s challenges so that you can offer the most in-demand\r\n        solution. Check.</p>\r\n    <p>Start by looking at niches where you\'re a member of the target audience yourself. This way, your domain expertise\r\n        shines through faster.</p>\r\n    <p>But don\'t think that after you\'ve gotten that far, you should find a generic list of 100 niches and narrow it down that way. <em>Watercolors? K-Pop? Travel? Good luck with that.&nbsp;</em></p>\r\n    <p>What is the #1 most important factor when choosing your blog\'s niche?</p>\r\n    <p><strong>How much your audience is willing to spend.</strong></p>\r\n    <p>It\'s that simple.</p>\r\n    <p>Let\'s break it down.</p>\r\n    <p>So in this example, let\'s say you\'re planning to start a blog in the home design niche.</p>\r\n    <p>Your blog topics may pull in different readers. Visitors could include professional interior designers, college\r\n        design students, and even stay-at-home moms who want the latest home decor inspiration.</p>\r\n    <p>To monetize this niche, you would create a new blog and move your readers down the <a\r\n            href=\"https://www.uplead.com/sales-funnel/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">sales funnel</a>:</p>\r\n    <ul>\r\n        <li>First, you\'d create content to attract an audience</li>\r\n        <li>Then you\'d build out a home design \"freebie\" to get email opt-ins</li>\r\n        <li>Next, you could use affiliate marketing to promote home decor brands</li>\r\n        <li>Finally, you would offer your email subscribers a $300 online course (with a money-back guarantee) about\r\n            <em>10 Expert Interior Design Tips for the Perfect Home</em></li>\r\n    </ul>\r\n    <p>Nothing is wrong with this approach – this tends to be what most bloggers do, and it can earn some passive income\r\n        after a couple of years of building your audience.</p>\r\n    <p><strong>But is it a lucrative audience?</strong> Stay-at-home moms, college students, and a few professionals\r\n        with an average salary?</p>\r\n    <p>Here\'s the secret.</p>\r\n    <p>By changing just one word in your niche, you can increase your blog\'s income potential by 200x.</p>\r\n    <p>All you do is change \"home design\" to \"retail design.\"</p>\r\n    <p>Let me explain.</p>\r\n    <p>By adding a B2B component, you just shifted your audience from individuals to businesses and increased your\r\n        blog\'s income potential by 200x.</p>\r\n    <p><strong>Think about it this way.</strong> If you\'re selling to large businesses instead of individuals, you make\r\n        more money for two reasons. The first is that they have more funds available. Second, it\'s not coming out of\r\n        their own pocket.</p>\r\n    <p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-1349\"\r\n            src=\"/static/image/blog/Marketing-Budgets-By-Industry.png\"\r\n            alt=\"Marketing Budgets By Industry\"\r\n            srcset=\"/static/image/blog/Marketing-Budgets-By-Industry.png 729w, /static/image/blog/Marketing-Budgets-By-Industry-300x179.png 300w, /static/image/blog/Marketing-Budgets-By-Industry-555x330.png 555w\"\r\n            sizes=\"(max-width: 729px) 100vw, 729px\" data-pin-description=\"Marketing Budgets By Industry\" width=\"729\"\r\n            height=\"434\"></p>\r\n    <p><em>Source: <a href=\"https://www.imab2b.com/News/b2b-marketing-budgets.aspx\" target=\"_blank\"\r\n                      rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">imab2b.com</a></em></p>\r\n    <p>The beautiful thing about this approach is that your blog launch, content strategy, and sales funnel are almost\r\n        the same for both the B2C \"home design\" and B2B \"retail design\" niches.</p>\r\n    <p><strong>Here\'s the good part:</strong> while the B2C \"home design\" monetization stopped at a $300 course, the B2B\r\n        \"retail design\" niche doesn\'t just stop there.</p>\r\n    <p>After you build your professional brand, you become known as a B2B design expert. This influence allows your\r\n        price to jump from a $20 affiliate commission or a $300 course – to a $5,000/month recurring consulting\r\n        service.</p>\r\n    <p>Understanding your audience\'s pain points isn\'t enough.</p>\r\n    <p>To 200x your revenue potential, your audience needs to be in a lucrative B2B niche and pay a monthly recurring\r\n        basis.</p>\r\n    <p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-1521\"\r\n            src=\"/static/image/blog/Monthly-Recurring-Revenue-1.jpg\"\r\n            alt=\"Recurring Affiliate Programs\"\r\n            srcset=\"/static/image/blog/Monthly-Recurring-Revenue-1.jpg 800w, /static/image/blog/Monthly-Recurring-Revenue-1-300x156.jpg 300w, /static/image/blog/Monthly-Recurring-Revenue-1-768x400.jpg 768w, /static/image/blog/Monthly-Recurring-Revenue-1-555x289.jpg 555w\"\r\n            sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" data-pin-description=\"Recurring Affiliate Programs\" width=\"800\"\r\n            height=\"417\"></p>\r\n    <p style=\"text-align: left;\"><em>Source: <a href=\"https://www.datapine.com/blog/monthly-recurring-revenue/\"\r\n                                                target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Datapine.com</a></em></p>\r\n    <p>To recap, when choosing your niche, rather than worrying about your passions and getting thousands of passive,\r\n        low-value site visitors, focus on closing 2-3 high-value clients.</p>\r\n    <p>With this approach, I hope you\'re beginning to understand why I truly believe you can make $10,000/month in 90\r\n        days with a new blog.</p>\r\n    <h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"2-use-your-professional-leverage-to-choose-your-blogs-niche\">2. Use Your Professional Leverage to Choose Your Blog\'s Niche</span>\r\n    </h3>\r\n    <p>After uncovering a lucrative audience to provide value to, the next step is to discover the strategic advantages\r\n        you may have over others.</p>\r\n    <p><strong>Ask yourself:</strong></p>\r\n    <ul>\r\n        <li>What is my current level of professional experience?</li>\r\n        <li>What connections do I have in my industry?</li>\r\n        <li>Can I leverage this experience into a profitable blog?</li>\r\n        <li>If I could pitch any website in the world to contribute a guest post, who would take me seriously from the\r\n            start?\r\n        </li>\r\n    </ul>\r\n    <p>To build a truly successful blog, you first need to build influence. And to build authority, you need to step\r\n        outside of your comfort zone and leverage your connections, professional experience, and everything at your\r\n        disposal like never before.</p>\r\n    <p>You will also be performing a lot of outreach to make new connections.</p>\r\n    <p>Outreach includes building relationships so you can guest post on authoritative sites in your niche. These posts\r\n        give you get relevant, high Domain Authority (DA) backlinks for SEO, which is still one of the best ways to rise\r\n        in the Google search rankings. And according to Broadband Search\'s recent <a\r\n                href=\"https://www.broadbandsearch.net/blog/internet-statistics\">Internet statistics from 2019</a>,\r\n        Google process 3.5 billion searches per day – or over 40,000 every second. There\'s plenty of traffic to go\r\n        around.</p>\r\n    <p>And when you\'re just starting, you may not have many connections or published content out there. You might say:\r\n        \"Why would anyone feature me?\"</p>\r\n    <p>Leveraging your background helps tremendously.</p>\r\n    <p>For example, if you\'re a photographer, you might have a base of clients, contacts from local meet-up groups, and\r\n        even know photography influencers that you met in the past. If you can leverage these contacts in the future,\r\n        you can accelerate the growth of your blog.</p>\r\n    <h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"3-your-niche-needs-market-demand\">3. Your Niche Needs Market Demand</span></h3>\r\n    <p>Before you get started, you need to do some research and see if people search for your topics and pay for\r\n        solutions.</p>\r\n    <p>Once you understand your leverage and passions, take your chosen niche, and come up with the top 10 keywords to\r\n        target.</p>\r\n    <p>Next, use a keyword research tool like the free Google Keyword Planner or a better SEO tool like <a\r\n            href=\"https://www.ahrefs.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Ahrefs</a> and enter your keywords.\r\n        If your top 5 keywords have search volumes of at least 5,000, this shows that there is interest in these topics.\r\n        Here\'s an example of my target keyword in this blog post:</p>\r\n    <p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-1346\"\r\n            src=\"/static/image/blog/Ahrefs-How-to-Make-Money-Blogging-Keyword.jpg\"\r\n            alt=\"Ahrefs How to Make Money Blogging Keyword\"\r\n            srcset=\"/static/image/blog/Ahrefs-How-to-Make-Money-Blogging-Keyword.jpg 800w, /static/image/blog/Ahrefs-How-to-Make-Money-Blogging-Keyword-300x123.jpg 300w, /static/image/blog/Ahrefs-How-to-Make-Money-Blogging-Keyword-768x315.jpg 768w, /static/image/blog/Ahrefs-How-to-Make-Money-Blogging-Keyword-555x228.jpg 555w\"\r\n            sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" data-pin-description=\"Ahrefs How to Make Money Blogging Keyword\"\r\n            width=\"800\" height=\"328\"></p>\r\n    <p>After that, look at the keyword difficulty score (a number from 0 to 100 on how difficult it will be to rank for\r\n        the keyword). If your keywords have difficulty scores of 0.8 or higher, the competition may be too fierce for\r\n        you to make an impact. Shoot for target keywords with over 5,000 monthly searches and under a 0.4 difficulty\r\n        score so that you can potentially get more traffic with less competition.</p>\r\n    <p>Another way to view competition is to use an SEO tool like Ahrefs to see search engine results page (SERP) data.\r\n        Specifically, look for the Domain Authority (DA) of the first page results and the SERP position history.</p>\r\n    <p>If the top 10 results all have a DA over 65, your new blog with a DA of 0 is not going to get on page one, thus\r\n        getting no traffic. However, if you see a website with a DA under 30 on page one, you can pass them with better\r\n        content. If the SERP position history hasn\'t budged over the last six months, the competition might be too\r\n        fierce.</p>\r\n    <p>To recap, when researching your blog\'s market demand, shoot for topics that have keywords with:</p>\r\n    <ul>\r\n        <li>5,000+ monthly searches</li>\r\n        <li>A keyword difficulty score under 0.4</li>\r\n        <li>The first page of Google has at least one site with a DA under 30</li>\r\n        <li>A SERP position history that has changed recently.</li>\r\n    </ul>\r\n    <p>To summarize, focus less on writing and more on keyword research. Choose your niche based on audience budget\r\n        potential, professional leverage, and market demand.</p>\r\n    <p>Find an audience that you\'re a part of and understand their challenges personally. Up-level that audience to make\r\n        sure there\'s a B2B component to 200x your revenue potential. Leverage your network, job experience, and\r\n        everything else at your disposal. And make sure your niche has market demand.</p>\r\n    <p><strong>Because in the end, passion doesn\'t create money; money creates passion.</strong></p>\r\n    <h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"scale-your-content-creation-and-stop-writing-so-much\">Scale Your Content Creation and Stop Writing So Much</span>\r\n    </h2>\r\n    <p>What if I told you that your blog\'s first 90 days has nothing to do with your blog and you won\'t write a single\r\n        word?</p>\r\n    <p>What if the secret to scaling and making money blogging doesn\'t include blogging?</p>\r\n    <p>What if everything taught about growing a new blog has limited your growth?</p>\r\n    <p>Remember: you\'re a business owner, not just a blogger.</p>\r\n    <p>From days 0 to 90, you won\'t be writing a single word.

Relationships Are Your Foundation</span></h3>\r\n    <p>Before you start building relationships with other bloggers and influencers in your niche, you have to understand\r\n        one central theme. You have to provide value to others. Don\'t go into the process of building a relationship\r\n        just thinking about what you\'ll get out of the deal. First, you need to focus on the benefits you\'ll give\r\n        others.</p>\r\n    <p><strong>Ask yourself:</strong> what value are you providing in the relationship?</p>\r\n    <ul>\r\n        <li>Could you provide content because your expertise matches their audience\'s interests?</li>\r\n        <li>Is their blog currently in need of content to fill their editorial calendar?</li>\r\n        <li>Can you leverage link building for them in other guest posts you\'re writing?</li>\r\n        <li>Is there a topic that you\'re well versed in that doesn\'t exist on their blog?</li>\r\n    </ul>\r\n    <p>The first step in pitching is understanding your value and what you can do to help. This information will be\r\n        vital in your initial email outreach strategy.</p>\r\n    <p>First, create a targeted list of sites.</p>\r\n    <p>Once you understand the value you can provide, it\'s time to start building your blog outreach list. This list\r\n        should be a simple spreadsheet with five columns: Website, Name, Email Address, Status, etc.</p>\r\n    <p>To begin populating your spreadsheet, look up the target blog\'s monthly site visitors and Domain Authority (DA)\r\n        by plugging their URL into an SEO tool like <a href=\"https://www.ahrefs.com\" target=\"_blank\"\r\n                                                       rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Ahrefs</a>. Aim for blogs with a Domain\r\n        Authority of 50+.</p>\r\n    <p>Remember, the higher the DA, the stronger the partnership potential, and the more SEO impact you\'ll receive from\r\n        the relationship. To save time during your search, find an article like this one with the <a\r\n                href=\"https://www.advancedwebranking.com/blog/150-sites-to-guest-post/\" target=\"_blank\"\r\n                rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">top blogs and websites accepting guest posts in 2019</a>, with Domain\r\n        Authority scores.</p>\r\n    <p>Once you\'ve pared down your list of blogs based on the criteria above It\'s time to find the right person to\r\n        contact.</p>\r\n    <p>First, use LinkedIn. Start by filtering your search results by the blog\'s company page, then within the company,\r\n        search for people by using terms like: \"Content Manager,\" \"SEO Manager,\" \"Editor,\" or simply, \"Content.\"</p>\r\n    <p>After you find 2-3 potential contacts, connect with them on LinkedIn. 2nd degree LinkedIn connections are better\r\n        than 3rd – and if you have a mutual contact, even better. Don\'t spend too much time on your connection message\r\n        either, often your text gets buried or comes off as spammy.</p>\r\n    <p>Once you\'ve reached out on LinkedIn, use an email tool like Hunter.io to scan the blog for email addresses. Even\r\n        if you can\'t find the contact\'s exact email address, Hunter.io shows your email structure, such as <em>firstname@blog.com</em>\r\n        or <em>firstname.lastname@blog.com</em>. Add this contact information into your spreadsheet.</p>\r\n    <h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"2-start-relationships-pitch-guest-posts-at-the-same-time\">2.

Check their editorial guidelines, look into how they write their\r\n            blog posts, and try to match their blog\'s style.\r\n        </li>\r\n    </ol>\r\n    <p>Once your topic is accepted, you can move onto the heart of your guest blogging strategy.</p>\r\n    <h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"3-the-importance-of-guest-blogging\">3.

Note:\r\n            59% of customers say that personalization <a\r\n                    href=\"https://blog.zoominfo.com/26-personalization-statistics-b2b-marketer/\" target=\"_blank\"\r\n                    rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">influences their shopping decision</a></li>\r\n        <li>Next, you can create drip campaigns and link sequences together based on actions inside of emails.</li>\r\n        <li>Finally, it\'s perfect for bloggers because their text emails look professional and don\'t have annoying\r\n            branding like with MailChimp and other platforms.\r\n        </li>\r\n    </ul>\r\n    <p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-1351\"\r\n            src=\"/static/image/blog/ConvertKit-Automation.jpg\" alt=\"ConvertKit Automation\"\r\n            srcset=\"/static/image/blog/ConvertKit-Automation.jpg 1000w, /static/image/blog/ConvertKit-Automation-300x182.jpg 300w, /static/image/blog/ConvertKit-Automation-768x465.jpg 768w, /static/image/blog/ConvertKit-Automation-555x336.jpg 555w\"\r\n            sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" data-pin-description=\"ConvertKit Automation\" width=\"1000\"\r\n            height=\"605\"></p>\r\n    <p>Remember, simple text emails will generate the most revenue for your blog. Don\'t worry about fancy design\r\n        features, adding your logo, or a bunch of images.</p>\r\n    <p>Think about it. If a sales professional was trying to close a $3,000 deal, what kind of email would they send? It\r\n        would be a text-based email based on a healthy relationship, not an impersonal, image-heavy marketing email.</p>\r\n    <p>In unison with the email platform, OptinMonster is the best email\r\n        opt-in tool out there. It\'s a WordPress plugin that you can easily integrate with your blog (and ConvertKit) to\r\n        generate more email subscribers.</p>\r\n    <p>With OptinMonster, you create different types of\r\n        opt-ins, including exit-intent pop-ups, sidebar opt-ins, and even forms within your blog posts themselves. I\r\n        have one exit-intent pop-up, one sidebar opt-in, one on specific pages, and one at the end of blog posts.</p>\r\n    <p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-1352\"\r\n            src=\"/static/image/blog/OptinMonster-Campaign.jpg\" alt=\"OptinMonster Campaign\"\r\n            srcset=\"/static/image/blog/OptinMonster-Campaign.jpg 1000w, /static/image/blog/OptinMonster-Campaign-300x142.jpg 300w, /static/image/blog/OptinMonster-Campaign-768x362.jpg 768w, /static/image/blog/OptinMonster-Campaign-555x262.jpg 555w\"\r\n            sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" data-pin-description=\"OptinMonster Campaign\" width=\"1000\"\r\n            height=\"472\"></p>\r\n    <p>With these email opt-in types on your blog, you are maximizing the number of potential visitors entering your\r\n        email funnel and <a href=\"https://www.addthis.com/ecommerce-tools/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">converting\r\n            your visitors into customers</a>.</p>\r\n    <h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\"\r\n              id=\"how-much-money-can-you-make-blogging\">How Much Money Can You Make Blogging?</span></h2>\r\n    <p>Bloggers are making money in all kinds of ways. Successful bloggers can make over 7-figures/year, while other\r\n        bloggers might be generating no income at all. A goal that many bloggers tell you to shoot for is $2,000/month\r\n        in recurring income within one year. However, with my monetization strategies below, I made $17k of monthly\r\n        recurring revenue in the first 90 days.</p>\r\n    <p>So let\'s start monetizing your blog.</p>\r\n    <p>You\'ve chosen your blog\'s niche, outsourced your content, and planned your blog monetization timeline. It\'s time\r\n        to learn how much money you can make blogging in 90 days.</p>\r\n    <p><strong>Before you tackle this plan, you will need:</strong></p>\r\n    <ul>\r\n        <li>A WordPress

 </li>\r\n        <li>Five pillar blog posts you want to promote.</li>\r\n        <li>All web pages complete: About Page, Start Here Page, Contact Page, Consulting Page, Resources Page, Email\r\n            Opt-In Page, etc.\r\n        </li>\r\n        <li>Email marketing software set up with opt-ins in your sidebar, in blog posts, and upon exit intent.</li>\r\n        <li>An active email sales funnel with a welcome email series – using ConvertKit\r\n            and OptinMonster.\r\n        </li>\r\n        <li>A content marketing writer or freelancer ready who will help with your guest post pipeline.</li>\r\n    </ul>\r\n    <p>Once you have these covered and launch your blog, your 90-day blog monetization plan can begin.</p>\r\n    <p>You\'ll notice that this plan to make money blogging consists of almost 100% outreach.</p>\r\n    <p>Since you have your original content, sales funnel, and blog posts published, <strong>you maximize impact by\r\n        building relationships and getting backlinks.</strong></p>\r\n    <p>The main outreach targets include influencer relationships, your professional network, your high-end client\r\n        personas, and blogging

Sell 200 affiliate marketing products at $50 per sale every<em> month</em>. Or B. Close 3-4 high-end\r\n        consulting deals. Which is easier? The affiliate marketing option may require 25,000-50,000+ monthly site\r\n        visitors; the consulting option only requires a little expertise and a sales funnel.</p>\r\n    <h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"summary-can-you-make-a-living-blogging\">Summary – Can You Make a Living Blogging?</span>\r\n    </h2>\r\n    <p>Yes, money from blogging can be very lucrative.

September Takeaways</strong>:</h2>\r\n    <h3>1. <a href=\"https://www.adamenfroy.com/best-high-paying-affiliate-programs\">Affiliate Programs.</a></h3>\r\n    <p>In September, I made $18,079 from 27 affiliate programs.</p>\r\n    <p>First, over 1,000 podcasters have signed up for paid plans based on my hosting recommendations.</p>\r\n    <p><strong>In <a href=\"https://www.adamenfroy.com/best-web-hosting-services\">web hosting</a>, I made $1,158 from 16\r\n        sales</strong>, which is actually down from August. The hosting space is extremely competitive – my article\r\n        peaked at #12 for “best web hosting” but has hovered around #14-15 on Google since. My ultimate goal is to rank\r\n        in the top 5 for “best web hosting” but I’ll have to unseat major sites like CNET, Techradar, and PC Mag.</p>\r\n    <p>Flexjobs is still showing strong performance, being featured in my <a\r\n            href=\"https://www.adamenfroy.com/how-to-make-money-online\">How to Make Money Online</a> and <a\r\n            href=\"https://www.adamenfroy.com/work-from-home-jobs\">Work from Home Jobs</a> articles. I received 540 from\r\n        36 sales.</p>\r\n    <p>I’m also starting to generate sales from website builders, ecommerce platforms, and webinar software, with Wix,\r\n        Shopify, BigCommerce, and Easy Webinar entering the mix.</p>\r\n    <p>Right now, I’m in over 100 <a href=\"https://www.adamenfroy.com/best-high-paying-affiliate-programs\">affiliate\r\n        programs</a>, with 27 bringing in revenue this month. Affiliate marketing is certainly a numbers game and no\r\n        matter your niche, you need to join a lot of them.</p>\r\n    <p><strong>Overall, I increased my passive affiliate income by 50% this month to $18k.</strong></p>\r\n    <p>This proves to me that you can start to generate some strong passive income by month 9 (or sooner) with the right\r\n        strategies.</p>\r\n    <h3>3. SEO Consulting.</h3>\r\n    <p>I currently work with 8 clients and provide them with SEO consulting, link building, and brand mention services.\r\n        My <a href=\"https://www.adamenfroy.com/content-marketing-consultant\">SEO and content marketing consulting</a>\r\n        revenue increased to $16.7k this month. This income is easy to generate because it is tied to my <a\r\n                href=\"https://www.adamenfroy.com/guest-blogging\">guest blogging strategy</a> – I would be creating these\r\n        guest posts to get links anyway. The fact that I can get paid to help others while I do it is a great setup.</p>\r\n    <p>Here’s a screenshot of my September invoices:</p>\r\n    <p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-42830\"\r\n            src=\"/static/image/report/Invoices-for-September.jpg\" alt=\"SEO Consulting Invoices\"\r\n            srcset=\"/static/image/report/Invoices-for-September.jpg 800w, /static/image/report/Invoices-for-September-300x115.jpg 300w, /static/image/report/Invoices-for-September-768x295.jpg 768w, /static/image/report/Invoices-for-September-555x213.jpg 555w\"\r\n            sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" data-pin-description=\"SEO Consulting Invoices\" width=\"800\"\r\n            height=\"307\"></p>\r\n    <h2><strong>3.

Email Subscribers for September 2019: <span style=\"color: #339966;\">+1,894</span></strong></h2>\r\n    <p>Astonishingly, I only make 1% of my revenue from my email list. As I’ve scaled up my blog’s traffic, I’ve been\r\n        hyper-focused on increasing affiliate revenue, as it is more passive and easy to manage than digital product\r\n        sales and courses to a list.</p>\r\n    <p>Not that I don’t love everyone on my email list – I do. It just takes more time to manage and answer emails, and\r\n        time freedom was the reason I started this blog.</p>\r\n    <p>However, this is an untapped area for my site I plan to work on more over the following months.</p>\r\n    <p>I use ConvertKit for my email marketing and added 1,894 new email subscribers in September to increase my list\r\n        over 7k.</p>\r\n    <h2><strong>5.
